# GitHub Pages Configuration Instructions

## Current Issue:
GitHub is running both:
1. ✅ Your custom "Deploy Hugo site to GitHub Pages" workflow (KEEP THIS)
2. ❌ Automatic "pages build and deployment" workflow (REMOVE THIS)

## Solution:
You need to configure GitHub Pages to ONLY use GitHub Actions, not branch deployment.

### Steps to Fix:
1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/maythinkyi/maythinkyi.github.io
2. Click **Settings** (top menu)
3. Scroll down to **Pages** (left sidebar)
4. Under **Source**:
   - Current setting is likely: "Deploy from a branch" 
   - ❌ Change it to: **"GitHub Actions"**
5. Save the changes

### What this does:
- ❌ Disables automatic Jekyll-based deployment from master branch
- ✅ Only allows GitHub Actions workflows to deploy
- ✅ Your Hugo workflow will be the sole deployment method

### Verification:
After changing the setting, only your "Deploy Hugo site to GitHub Pages" 
workflow should appear in the Actions tab, and the automatic 
"pages build and deployment" should stop running.

## Alternative Quick Fix:
If you can't access the settings, create an empty `.github/CODEOWNERS` 
file which sometimes helps GitHub recognize this as an Actions-only repository.
